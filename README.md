# San Francisco Housing Data Analysis

The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze the real estate data in San Francisco. The data includes housing unit and price information from 2010 to 2016, broken down by neighborhood.

## Requirements

The assignment requires the use of the `hvPlot` and `GeoViews` libraries to visualize the data. Additionally, the `sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv` file must be read into the notebook and used to create the DataFrames used in the analysis.

## Tasks

The main tasks in this challenge are as follows:

1. Calculate and plot the housing units per year.
2. Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.
3. Compare the average prices by neighborhood.
4. Build an interactive neighborhood map.
5. Compose a data story.

## Note

All of the above tasks must be completed in the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
